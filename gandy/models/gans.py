class GAN(gandy.models.models.UncertaintyModel):
    """
    Implements Generative Adversarial Networks.

    A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a type of generative model.
    It consists of two parts called the "generator" and the "discriminator".
    The generator takes random noise as input and transforms it into an
    output that (hopefully) resembles the training data. The discriminator
    takes a set of samples as input and tries to distinguish the real
    training samples from the ones created by the generator. Both of them
    are trained together. The discriminator tries to get better and better
    at telling real from false data, while the generator tries to get better
    and better at fooling the discriminator.

    Thank you to deepchem at
    https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem/blob/master/deepchem/models/gan.py#L14-L442
    for the information about GANS.
